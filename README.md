# Requirements
Students will be tasked with creating a scenario including reactive ‘Guard’ AI agents and a planning based ‘Spy’ AI agent. The role of the ‘Guard’ agents will be to patrol a given area and react to the ‘Spy’ in an attempt to catch them. The role of the ‘Spy agent will be to avoid the ‘Guard’ agents to successfully achieve a given goal (e.g. collect a key then get to the exit).


## The ‘Guard’ AI Agent must:
- Include a number of different actions (e.g. patrol, chase, search). 
- Include sequences of compound logic (i.e. through the use of sequences and selectors). 
- Include a sensory system (e.g. hearing, sight). 
- Evidence of knowledge/event management.


## The ‘Spy’ AI Agent must:
- Include a sensory system (e.g. hearing, sight). 
- Evidence of knowledge/event management.
- For a basic implementation the Spy may use Behaviour Trees to achieve their goal (once again using compound logic.) 
- For a more advanced implementation Students must implement some form of planning AI (STRIPS/HTN) for the Spy agent, or rule-based system (GOB).


| Grade  | Content |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| To achieve <30   | Project does not compile, contains compilation errors, does not run or is missing multiple deliverables.  |
| To achieve <40   | Project code compiles but contains multiple unaddressed warnings. Project is incomplete or missing key components (e.g. no behaviour trees, planner or utility system). Level of programming does not meet level outlined in the coding standards document for this subject.  |
| To achieve 40+   | Project is able to be compiled and run without error. Project includes a basic attempt at a Behaviour Tree AI system and use of compound logic. Inclusion of a basic sensory system (hearing/sight).  |
| To achieve 50+   | Meets the requirements for 40+ and meets the coding standards. Project includes a satisfactory implementation of a Behaviour Tree AI and sensory systems. Demonstration of good programming practice is evident in source code.  |
| To achieve 60+   | Meets the requirements for 50+ and additionally shows effort has been made to make sure code is efficient and as clean as possible with thorough commenting throughout. Project includes a good implementation of a Behaviour Tree and AI sensory system. For 65+ the ‘Spy’ agent demonstrates the ability to adapt to changes in environment through the use of a more advanced form of AI (e.g. GOAP, GOB). Sound knowledge of programming principles is demonstrated in source code.  |
| To achieve 70+   | Meets the requirements for 60+. Advanced AI is built to a high standard and chosen scenario demonstrates the capabilities of the agent well. Code is well written and efficient, good knowledge of programming principles is demonstrated in source code.  |
| To achieve 80+   | Meets the requirements for 70+ and additionally exceeds the requirements outlined in the evidence table in this document. Work demonstrates student has seen all possibilities in the task and gone beyond the original brief to create a high quality portfolio project.  |
